Name 
 - Difficluties : Not much

 - solved : Resolve with simple CSS and animations using infinites

Exercise 
 - Difficluties : It was difficult to fix the part and to change the four sides as it became transformed

 - solved : Solve the rest of the parts except for fixing by using a negative figure of skewY

Major
 - Difficluties : Not much

 - solved : Set the radius and time of rotation in the transform and solve it by adjusting the overall size before and after rotation

Hobby
 - Difficluties : It was difficult to set each situation according to the four progresses

 - solved : Resolve by changing one by one with reference points

Meal
 - Difficluties : It was difficult to hold it in one position and avoid colliding with Hobby

 - solved : Implement stopping during rotation and then changing parts

Book
 - Difficluties : Most difficult, the position changed with the movement of the Hobby above, which seems to have taken a lot of time to figure out the pattern

 - solved : Before solving, stop the video by size and divide it into 4 patterns, and solve it by automatically adjusting it according to size through scaleX
